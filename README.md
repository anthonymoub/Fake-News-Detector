# Fake News Detector

**Abstract**: The project involved training the LSTM model using a dataset of news articles labeled as either fake or real. The training process aimed to optimize the model's performance in accurately detecting fake news while minimizing false positives.

The final testing accuracy of the model was found to be 98%, indicating its high accuracy in detecting fake news. This achievement is significant in the fight against the spread of misinformation and the preservation of the public's trust in journalism.

The potential impact of this project is substantial, as the fake news detector can be utilized by news organizations, social media platforms, and other relevant entities to combat the spread of fake news. The next step for this project is to test for overfitting as well as deploy model to a web application that users could use for themselves.


The Data collected was 2 csv files, one for every type of news, and it was collected from the following Github repo: https://github.com/laxmimerit/fake-real-news-dataset
